## Question 1
I commented out purge files in the example yaml file, and use the one attached (02_postgres_taxi.yml) to ingest yellow_tripdata_2020-12.csv. 
and I checked logs in the executions, the file size is 128.3MB. 

## Question 2 
The file name should be **green_tripdata_2020-04.csv**.

## Question 3
I use the following sql to count Yellow Taxi data for all CSV files in the year 2020?

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM yellow_tripdata
WHERE filename LIKE 'yellow_tripdata_2020-%';
```
